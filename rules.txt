ferment_finish_gravity is the measured specific gravity at our self determined end of ferment to be used on the formulas to do live all the calculations made (corrected gravity, ABV%, SMV)
ferment_finish_brix is the measured percent brix at our self determined end of ferment to be used on the formulas to do live all the calculations made (corrected gravity, ABV%, SMV)
final_measured_temp_C is the measured temperature in C at which final measurments took place
final_measured_gravity is a measured float value for the specific gravity of the final product
final_measured_Brix_% is a measured float value for perecent brix
final_gravity is a calculated formula using values from the table  if(not(isblank(final_measured_temp_C)), LET(  mt, INDEX(final_measured_temp_C, ROW()),  mg, INDEX(final_measured_gravity, ROW()),  ct, 20,  pmt, 0.999005559846799 - 0.000020305299748608*mt + 0.0000058871378337408*mt^2 - 0.00000001357811768736*mt^3,  pct, 0.999005559846799 - 0.000020305299748608*ct + 0.0000058871378337408*ct^2 - 0.00000001357811768736*ct^3,  ROUND(mg * pmt / pct, 4)),"") --- ct is calibrated temp for the hydrometer include an option to enter a different temp but default to 20
ABV_% is a calculated formula using values from the table  if(not(isblank(final_measured_temp_C)), let(b, index(final_measured_Brix_%, ROW()), fg, index(final_gravity, ROW()), round(1.646*b-2.703*(145-145/fg)-1.794,1)),"")
SMV is a calculated formula using values from the table  if(not(isblank(final_measured_temp_C)), let(fg, index(final_gravity, ROW()), ROUND(1443/fg-1443,1)), "")
final_water_addition_mL how much water was added to the final ferment to before proofing down for the final measurements?
clarified boolean if process was undertaken (can be check box)
pasteurized boolean if process was undertaken (can be check box)
pasteruization_notes if pasteurized process taken, what notes if any are there?
finishing_additions what final addtion notes are there?


Ingredients table: ID indicates in-database reference for that ingredient type indicates what type of ingredient (category rice can be used for making koji or kake), acc_date indicate accession date into the database as a defined ingredient


Starters table: Date is the date the starter was created (should be a DATE type); StarterBatch is a in-database ID to be used when noting starting conditons of a batch; BatchID is the unifying ID for a batch across tables and the batch that this starter entry is going into; Amt_Kake is how much kake rice was added into the starter in grams and should contribute to the total_kake_g column in the recipe table; Amt_Koji is how much koji rice was added into the starter in grams and should contribute to the total_koji_g column in the recipe table; Amt_water is how much liquid was added to the starter in ml; water_type is a categorical ingredientID from the ingredient table of the category water (spring, well, distilled); Kake is ingredientID for a rice or kake_rice type from the ingredient table; Koji is ingredientID for a rice or koji_rice type from the ingredient table; yeast is ingredientID for a yeast type from the ingredient table;lactic_acid should be grames of lactic acid solution added;MgSO4 should be grams of MgSO4 added;KCl should be grams of KCL added; temp_C is a temperature in C at which the starter began it's ferment


PublishNotes Table: pared down version of details from the recipe table, using good puncutation and grammar for public view
BatchID the unifying reference key across tables for the batch
Pouch_Date indicates when the batch was completed and pouched (use a date type)
Style a categorical limited to the few types you have seen (pure,rustic,rustic_experimental)
Water is a categorical ingredientID from the ingredient table of the category water (spring, well, distilled)

Batch_Size_L total_water_mL from recipe table plus any final water or finishing additions volume converted to L
Rice description of kake_rice used in the batch coming from the ingredient table
Description tasting notes and brief sake recipe description.


formulas page should be a couple of live calculators based on entered values, for mocking up and determining any final additions to add. include:
entry fields for calibrated hydrometer temp (assume 20C or 15.6C), measured specific gravity, measured %Brix
live calculate SMV and ABV% from corrected gravity and measured %brix values
live calculate dilution or adjustments to bring the final corrected gravity, %Brix, SMV, and ABV% to a target profile. Target profiles include: Pure (11% brix, 1.005 SG) and Mixer (12% brix, 0.995 SG)
